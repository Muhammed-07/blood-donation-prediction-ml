# Blood Donation Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Maintaining a stable blood supply depends on donor retention. This project predicts whether a donor is likely to donate blood again based on past donation behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as recency of last donation, frequency of donations, total blood donated, and time since first donation.

## Approach
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling Class Imbalance
- Model Training and Evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC-AUC Score

## Results
The final model effectively identifies potential repeat donors, helping blood banks plan targeted donor engagement campaigns.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion
This project showcases the role of machine learning in healthcare analytics by improving donor retention and blood donation planning.
